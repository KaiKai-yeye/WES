You are an expert in bioinformatics data organization. I will provide a list of liver cancer sample filenames, which may be separated by tabs or spaces.
Filename Convention:
The filename is structured as: Sample ID + Sample Type + .pileups.table.
Cancer tissues: The Sample Type contains "T" or "M".
Control tissues: The Sample Type contains "L" (normal liver tissue) or "P" (para-cancerous tissue).
Your Task:
Group: Group all filenames based on their shared Sample ID.
Pair: Within each group, find one corresponding Control tissue for every Cancer tissue.
Pairing Priority: You must prioritize matching with an "L" type sample. If no "L" type sample exists for that Sample ID, then match with the "P" type sample.
If a single Sample ID has multiple cancer samples (e.g., T1, T2), they should all be paired with the same single control sample found for that ID.
Output Requirements:
You must output the results with one pair per line.
Format: Cancer_Sample_Name [tab] Control_Sample_Name
Crucial: The sample names in the output must have the .pileups.table suffix removed.
If a cancer sample cannot be paired with any control (neither "L" nor "P"), it should be excluded from the output.
